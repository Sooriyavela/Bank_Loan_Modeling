# Bank Loan Modeling

This repository contains a project focused on analyzing and predicting loan approvals for a bank. The goal is to build a machine learning model to classify loan applications based on customer data and improve decision-making.

## Project Overview

Loan approval is a critical process in banking, involving various criteria to assess applicants. This project explores the data, identifies significant features, and develops predictive models to determine the likelihood of loan approval.

### Goals:
- Perform data preprocessing and exploratory analysis.
- Build classification models for predicting loan approvals.
- Evaluate model performance using various metrics.

## Features

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics of the dataset.
- Visualization of key features such as:
  - Income distribution of applicants.
  - Loan amounts and their approval rates.
  - Relationships between categorical variables like gender, marital status, and loan approval.

### Modeling
- Machine learning algorithms implemented:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
  - ROC-AUC Curve
